# Coinage - A Coin Game

The idea behind this project is to create a game which is simple yet fun and entertaining at the same time. The name of the application is Coinage.

The objective of the game is for the man to collect as many coins as possible and increase his score. There are bombs present with the coins on the screen. The player has to be cautious to not collect any bombs. Collecting a bomb leads to the end of the game.The game was developed using libGDX on Android Studio. libGDX is a free and open-source game-development application framework written in the Java programming language with some C and C++ components for performance dependent code. It allows for the development of desktop and mobile games by using the same code base. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, BlackBerry and web browsers with WebGL support.
